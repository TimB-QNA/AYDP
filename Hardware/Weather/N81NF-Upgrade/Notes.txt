This is an upgrade to Maplin's wind direction sensor. The original sensor
consists of a PCB with eight reed switches and a pass-through for the
wind speed sensor. The new sensor hardware improves on this by using eight
hall-effect sensors and a 12-bit ADC on board. The pass-through for the
wind sensor is maintained. The updated sensor is not compatible with the
rest of the maplin kit; it requires the arduino base unit to function correctly.
