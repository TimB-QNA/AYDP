These are rather disorganised general notes.

Bluetooth:
JY-MCU module
Default BAUD is 9600
Default PIN is 1234
Connect to module over bluetooth with "rfcomm connect 0 00:14:03:02:09:53"
Tested on Raspberry PI and works well.
AT commands as this link http://wiki.openpilot.org/display/Doc/Serial+Bluetooth+Telemetry
AT commands seem to work, not fully tested.
Works from 3V3, so a level shifter will be needed for use with the arduino.

Raspberry PI UART
To use the uart remove the Serial tty line from /etc/inittab
Remove the console definition from /boot/command line
Can be accessed using minicom like: minicom -b 9600 -o -D /dev/ttyAMA0

GPS:
OSTARZ BIBXT 10Hz connected via USB
Works fine, appears as /dev/ttyACM0
A better device to use is /dev/serial/by-id/usb-MTK_GPS_Receiver-if01 as this should
always point to the same device and not increment if disconnected/reconnected
